Reverse Linked List in groups of Size K

Problem Statement: Given the head of a singly linked list of `n` nodes and an integer `k`, where k is less than or equal to `n`. Your task is to reverse the order of each group of `k` consecutive nodes, if `n` is not divisible by `k`, then the last group of remaining nodes should remain unchanged.

Example 1:

Input Format:

LL: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10
K = 3

Explanation:

Group 1: Reverse nodes 1 -> 2 -> 3 to become 3 -> 2 -> 1.
Group 2: Reverse nodes 4 -> 5 -> 6 to become 6 -> 5 -> 4.
Group 3: Reverse nodes 7 -> 8 -> 9 to become 9 -> 8 -> 7.
Node 10 remains as is since there are no more groups of size K remaining.
