Implement Upper Bound

Problem Statement: Given a sorted array of N integers and an integer x, write a program to find the upper bound of x.

Example 1:

Input Format:
 N = 4, arr[] = {1,2,2,3}, x = 2
Result:
 3
Explanation:
 Index 3 is the smallest index such that arr[3] > x.

Example 2:

Input Format:
 N = 6, arr[] = {3,5,8,9,15,19}, x = 9
Result:
 4
Explanation:
 Index 4 is the smallest index such that arr[4] > x.
