Row with max 1s

You are given a 2D array consisting of only 1's and 0's, where each row is sorted in non-decreasing order. You need to find and return the index of the first row that has the most number of 1s. If no such row exists, return -1.
Note: 0-based indexing is followed.

Examples:

Input: arr[][] = [[0, 1, 1, 1],
               [0, 0, 1, 1],
               [1, 1, 1, 1],
               [0, 0, 0, 0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Row 2 contains 4 1's.

Input: arr[][] = [[0, 0], 
               [1, 1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Row 1 contains 2 1's.
