Palindrome Partitioning

Problem Statement: You are given a string s, partition it in such a way that every substring is a palindrome. Return all such palindromic partitions of s.

Note: A palindrome string is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:

Input: s = “aab”

Output: [ ["a","a","b"], ["aa","b"] ]	

Explanation: The first  answer is generated by  making three partitions. The second answer is generated by making two partitions.

Example 2:

Input: s = “aabb”

Output: [ [“a”,”a”,”b”,”b”], [“aa”,”bb”], [“a”,”a”,”bb”], [“aa”,”b”,”b”] ]
