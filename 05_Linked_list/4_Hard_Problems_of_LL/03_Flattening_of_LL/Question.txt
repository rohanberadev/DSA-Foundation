Flattening a Linked List

Problem Statement: Given a linked list containing ‘N’ head nodes where every node in the linked list contains two pointers:

‘Next’ points to the next node in the list
‘Child’ pointer to a linked list where the current node is the head
Each of these child linked lists is in sorted order and connected by a 'child' pointer. Your task is to flatten this linked list such that all nodes appear in a single layer or level in a 'sorted order'.
